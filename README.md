I have been learning Java and some technologies lately. 

Nowadays, I work with SRE and Observability, but I'm trying to expand my view in the developing field. So as a first project, I will be creating a Registration and Login system using Spring as framework, Maven as repository manager, MySQL as database and, finally, JwT as authorization token.




## JWT
Jason Web Token, also known as JWT, is a token digitally assigned to assure secure information transmission.
It is usually used during authentication. Once the user has already proven he can be trusted, a key will be generated and can be used to access different resources that only will be available through the JWT token.
